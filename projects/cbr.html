    <h2 id="cf" align="center" name="ICBR">Introspective CBR</h2>

    <p>
    When AI technologies are applied to real-world problems, it is often difficult for developers to anticipate all
    possible eventualities. Especially in long-lived systems, changing circumstances may require changes not only to
    domain knowledge but also to the reasoning process that brings it to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
    This research investigates applying introspective reasoning to improve the performance of a case-based
    reasoning system, by guiding learning to improve how a case-based reasoning system applies its cases.
    The success of a CBR system depends not only on its cases, but also on its ability to use those cases
    appropriately in new situations, which depends on factors such as the system’s similarity
    measure and the case adaptation mechanism. Consequently, it is desirable to enable CBR systems to improve
    the knowledge and processes by which they bring their cases to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
    The goal of our introspective reasoning system is to detect reasoning failures and to refine the function
    of reasoning mechanisms, to improve system performance on future problems. To achieve this goal,
    the introspective reasoner monitors the reasoning process, determines the possible causes of its
    failures, and performs actions that will affect future reasoning processes.
    </p>
    <p>
    Our model is domain independent, that is, it is focused on the general case-based reasoning process
    for retrieval and adaptation, rather than on specific details of those processes for any particular domain.
    The model deals with three types of knowledge: indexing knowledge, ranking knowledge, and adaptation knowledge.
    To apply the model to any concrete application, domain-specific retrieval and adaptation mechanisms must
    be linked to the model.
    </p>
    <p>
    Introspective reasoning is organized into five tasks: <br/>
    (1) the monitoring task, in charge of maintaining a trace of the CBR process; <br/>
    (2) the quality assessment task, which analyzes the quality of the solutions proposed by the system; <br/>
    (3) the blame assessment task, responsible for identifying the reasoning failures; <br/>
    (4) the hypothesis generation task, in charge of proposing learning goals; and <br/>
    (5) the hypothesis evaluation task, which assesses the impact of proposed improvements on solution generation (see Figure below).

    <h2 id="noos" align="center">The Noos Representation Language</h2>

    <p>
    The aim of my PhD was the design and implementation of a representation
    language for developing knowledge systems that integrate problem solving
    and learning.
    Our proposal was that this goal could be achieved with a representation
    language with representation constructs close to knowledge modeling
    frameworks and with episodic memory and reflective capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
    We developed a reflective object-centered representation language
    close to knowledge modeling frameworks.
    The language was based on the task/method decomposition principle and the analysis
    of models required and constructed by problem solving methods.
    Formalizated using feature terms, a formal approach to
    object-centered representations, we provided a formalism for integrating
    different learning techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
    The integration of machine learning tasks has as implication that the
    knowledge modeling of the implemented knowledge system has to include
    modeling of learning goals.
    Moreover, machine learning techniques have to be modeled inside the KM
    framework and the knowledge requirements of ML have to be addressed.
    The integration of learning requires the capability of accessing
    (introspection) to solved problems (that we call episodes) and of
    modifying the knowledge of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
    The second proposal was that learning methods are methods (in the sense of
    knowledge modeling PSM) with introspection capabilities that can be also
    analyzed in the same task/method decomposition way.  Thus, learning methods
    can be uniformly represented as methods and integrated into our framework.
    </p>
    <p>
    The third proposal was that whenever some knowledge is required by a problem
    solving method, and that knowledge is not directly available, there is an
    opportunity for learning.  We called those opportunities impasses,
    following <a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar/home" target="_blank"><SMALL>SOAR</SMALL></a>
    terminology, and the integration of learning was
    realized by learning methods capable of solving these impasses.
    </p>
    <p>
    Examples of applications developed with Noos were presented.

    <h2 id="cf" align="center" name="cF">cF: yet another Case-Based Reasoning Framework</h2>

    <p>
    The cF Framework is a child of the Noos platform. The goal was to
    concentrate the efforts in providing a simple framework for developing prototypes
    of CBR applications.
